## Hello! :wave:

I am Jun Yu Tan (my first name is Jun Yu), currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Saleswhale (acquired by [6sense](https://6sense.com/)) building conversational AI to power automated lead conversion in sales and marketing teams. Since August 2023, I'm also pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).

I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a B.Sc. in [Data Science & Analytics](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/), and I'm passionate about building impactful AI experiences to ultimately help make our world more efficient and creative. These days, I place more focus on scalable ML systems, as well as exploring how we can make LLMs more reliable and steerable in AI-enabled products. I also have a strong interest in entrepreneurship and would love to embark on this journey one day.

Previously, I also worked on data science and machine learning projects with [eyos](https://eyos.one/), [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/), and [Micron](https://www.micron.com/). During my time at Micron, I performed research on novelty detection for predictive maintenance of manufacturing equipment using acoustic IoT systems.
